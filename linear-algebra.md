# Linear Algebra - Key Concepts Review 

## Lesson 1 
_7/1/19_

### Scalars
A scalar is a single number 

### Vectors
Have a direction as well as a magnitude

### Norm
It is a **length** (or magnitude) of a vector
Norm is denoted by double pipes ||v||

_Formula:_
1. Take each value of the vector
2. Square and add them up 
3. Calculate a square root of the value 

Joanne: A norm of a vector is just an extension of the Pythagorean theorem.

Norm of the vector is always more than 0 

> ||v|| > 0 

### Dot Product
Dot product or scalar product is an algebraic operation that takes two equal-length sequences of numbers and returns a single number. 

It is a single number.

### Cross Product
The cross product is a vector equivalent of a multiplication. The result is third vector that is **perpendicular** to the first two vectors.

a **X** b = cross product notation

R is the notation for Real number 

### Matrices
A matrix is a rectangular grid of numbers arranged in rows and columns. Variables representing matrices are generally written as **capital letters** (also sometimes boldfaced - if you want to be super formal).

Dimensionality in matrices is always represented by **number of rows** x (by) **number of columns**. For example, the matrix above is 2x4.  

### Matrix Equality
In order for 2 matrices to be equal, 2 conditions must be met:

1. They must have the same dimensions
2. Corresponding elements must be equal

### Matrix Multiplication
You can multiply any two matrices where the number of columns of the first matrix is equal to the number of rows of the second matrix. 

The easiest ways of thinking of matrix multiplication is in terms of dot product.

### Transpose
The transpose of a matrix is a new matrix whose rows are the columns of the original. (This makes the columns of the new matrix the rows of the original). Here is a matrix and its transpose: The superscript "T" means "transpose".

### Square Matrix

### Special kinds of Square Matrices

### Determinant

### Inverse
