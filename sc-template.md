_What went well:_

- I like that you did x, y, and z here:
```python
<insert code block here>
```

- This was a really good use of x:
```python
<insert code block here>
```
- Great visualization here. The use of `x` and `y` really made it `z`.

_What could be better:_

- Here you could have zigged instead of zagged:
```python
<insert code block here>
```

- Whereas here zagging might have sufficed:
```python
<insert code block here>
```
